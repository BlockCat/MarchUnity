## Todo:
- Map synchronization
- Character movement
    - Move left and right (should be able to move up inclined terrain, (if the normal of terrain has a higher than x degree?)    
    - Jump in the air!
- Gun system (we need a many!)

## Map idea:
- Server contains map information where every voxel is its own entity.
- Voxel is send to client,
- Client collects voxel in views
- and triangulate it
